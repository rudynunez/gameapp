You viciously bite the locust's head off and suck at the seeping juices. Ugh! You barely manage to refrain from vomiting. The taste is acrid and the texture is waxy and nauseating. Tears of stress well up in your eyes as You hold your nose and force yourself to gulp down the rest of its goopy innards.

The ordeal is over. Your stomach is full.

Congratulations on fulfilling the basic requirements of life.
