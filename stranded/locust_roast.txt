The locusts buzz and clack loudly as you sling the net over your shoulder. Arriving at your camp you solemnly do them in. You flip them studiously over the fire until their bodies brown. Steam hisses out from their carapaces and their juices drip, sizzling into the fire. The smell is delicious! One looks done so you pull it off the fire and break it open, blowing on the steaming goop inside until its cool enough to put in your mouth. The taste is rich and nutty but with and odd waxy aftertase, much better than you had imagined.

You eat your fill then you kick back and relax, happy to have satisfied all of your basic needs.

Now what?
