You decide to observe the animal life on your new planet. You climb a tree and situate yourself in the crook of a high branch. As you wait you see many strange insects pass by you.

A group of what seem to be giant locusts lands in a branch right next to you. You think youâ€™ve heard somewhere that locusts are edible.
