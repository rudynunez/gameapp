You awaken in the morning feeling rough but happy to see the sun shining through the trees. 

Youâ€™ve never felt so dehydrated in your life. Fortunately you can hear a running stream somewhere in the distance. You follow your ears to a little creek brimming with fresh water. You drink deeply and splash the cold water on your face. 

Now your stomach is rumbling. Better find some food.
