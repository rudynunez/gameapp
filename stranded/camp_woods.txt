There is something creepy about the ruins. You feel more at home in the forest. The sky is clear and it doesn’t look like rain so you find a nice flat spot and start building your fire pit. As night falls the forest comes alive with sound. The animal sounds are different from the ones back home. At first you pay no attention but soon you can’t help but notice just how alien the sounds are to you. Having no way of knowing what kinds of creatures are making the sounds makes you nervous. You lay awake all night, sleeping with one eye open. Pale light filters through the trees from a pair of crescent moons; one larger green moon and a smaller pink one. The sight of them is beautiful and you feel comforted by their arrival. Finally, you fall asleep.
