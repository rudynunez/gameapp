The heavy brown fruit is soft and ripe. The skin is thin. Cautiously you take a bite. It’s delicious! The flesh is dark brown throughout and has the texture of a juicy banana. It is sweet and divine. After eating three of the dense fruits you are satisfied. Maybe this planet won’t turn out to be so bad.
