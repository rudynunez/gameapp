Well, if you’re going to be hunting bugs, you’d better do it right. You ignore your growling stomach for now and get to work weaving together plant fibers to make a crude net. You work for hours to finally produce the net. It is bulky and heavy but it just might work. Before long you spot some more locusts in the tall grass. Seizing the opportunity you pounce. Success!

You now have 3 locusts trapped under your net.
