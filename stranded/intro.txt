You find yourself on a strange planet in a forest of unfamiliar plants. You wander aimlessly in a daze. The forest begins to thin out until it gives way to a desert. The sun will be setting soon as you step out of the forest. Before you stands the broken entrance to a ruined city that stretches for miles. The sight is breathtaking. Reddish stone walls jut from the pink sands. Dust devils play in the nooks and abandoned alleyways. What kind of beings could have lived here? The sun is setting and the air is getting colder. 

What will you do?
