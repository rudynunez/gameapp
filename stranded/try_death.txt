You decide to try it one more time. You lower down the jar, it hits bottom and you bring it back up, but again, no luck. The blowing dust stings your eyes and the afternoon sun beats down mercilessly. You are sweating and panting. Suddenly you get very dizzy and everything goes black. You fall to the sand. The last thing you hear is the sound of the empty jar shattering on the side of the well. Your bleached bones will be just another mystery in this ghost city.
