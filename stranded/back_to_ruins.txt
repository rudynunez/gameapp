Once again you are astounded by the immensity of the ruins. The beings who lived here must have put so much effort into creating such a city. What could have caused it to end? Did any of them survive? You half hope that they did survive and half hope that they didn't. What if you run into them and they're unfriendly or worse? You try to push the thought away. You must go on. Your only hope of getting off of this planet lies in your finding intelligent life. It's just a risk you're going to have to take.

You roam the ruins examining everything. As you get further in, you notice that some of the walls have some sort of picto-grams etched in them. Although the language is completely foreign to you, the pictures do seem to tell a story. There are some beings depicted who are basically humanoid but with strange features. There is a scene in which the beings look like they are making offerings to a ruler or a god who sits on a high throne.

In the next scene they are building what looks like a huge vehicle of some kind.

Next, they are standing in two long lines, boarding the vessel. Around the vessel are situated 6 pillars. On top of each pillar is a godlike ruler figure like the one shown earlier. Each of them holds a very elaborate scepter, each one different than the others.

In the last scene the vessel is full and has risen up from the ground. There is a crowd of beings on the ground looking up at the ship. All have their arms lifted high. The wall is broken here and the rest of the story is obliterated.
