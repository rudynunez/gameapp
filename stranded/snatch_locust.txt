Your hunger gives you wings. With lightening quickness you swipe at the nearest locust. Success! You now grasp the locust in your hand. However, you lose your balance and fall from your branch. The branches of the tree break your fall on your way to the ground. Ouch, that was painful. You’re scratched and bruised but you’ve still got the locust! It squirms in your grip. That’s one powerful insect. Better do something fast!
