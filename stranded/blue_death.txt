You manage to eat two of the blue fruits before the taste becomes unbearable. The bittersweet taste clings to the back of your throat.

Strangely, the cloying bittersweet flavor is persistent. In fact it seems to be getting stronger and it starts to take on a metallic taste . Suddenly you are gripped with a terrible thirst. You run to the stream and start to gulp the cold water. Just then your body starts itching all over. You are breaking out in hives! You watch as your hands and feet swell up like baloons. You feel your face puff up until your eyes are swollen shut. It isn't long before your windpipe is constricted and you fall gasping and wheezing to the ground.

Was it poison or just a bad allergy? This strange planet keeps its secrets.
