At the forest's edge you find some low growing vines that creep along the ground. They are plentiful and tough enough to twist into a long rope. It takes a long time but you manage to do it.

Fastening your rope to the ancient ceramic jar, you lower it down until it stops. It feels like it could be water. The jar feels heavier as you pull it up but it comes up empty.

You are sweating from your effort and your thirst has become overwhelming.
