There must be some intact buildings in the ruin; intact enough anyway. After a little bit of searching you come upon a small, rectangular stone building. It has no roof but itâ€™s the first structure you have found that has all four walls intact. You gather up some branches and wide thick leaves and to throw together a makeshift roof covering. You manage to cover half of the building and get some nice dry firewood as night falls. For the moment you are cozy and warm. You breathe a sigh of contentment as you wonder at the strange new constellations in the sky. To your surprise and delight, a bright green crescent moon creeps slowly over the horizon. As you gaze at its emerald beauty yet another, smaller crescent moon appears; dusky pink and dazzling to behold. You fall into a deep and dreamless sleep.
